# python_ray_tracing

Fun weekend project building a ray tracer in Python. The project follows the text of "Ray Tracing in a Weekend" by Peter Shirley, included in the literature/ folder.

The \*.py files are mainly class and function definitions. The rendering takes place in the scripts ray_tracer_\*.py, with ray_tracer_4.py incorporating all features of the guide.

The rendering is very slow for any decently sized image and degree of antialiasing, though a comparison to C++ code has not been done.
